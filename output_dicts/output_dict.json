I don\\'t know if it is due to voters being too overwhelmed with having to actually inform themselves over all parties before elections (bc basically over decades being used to yes/no answers on talking points to determine the party for them between option A or B) or because of politicians actually being unable to form working coalitions of multiple parties to make up a working fed gov and the other parties coalitioning to make up the opposition.\\\\n\\\\nThe second part would speak to my theory though.

After the mayor of Lancaster (a Republican who supports the Republican candidate in the special election) made a request for a in-person vote center in his city last week, the L.A. County Recorder/Clerk made arrangements for one to be available, which was [announced yesterday](https://lavote.net/docs/rrcc/news-releases/05122020_Second-Weekend.pdf). All active registered voters were mailed ballots for the election, but this adds options for people who didn\\'t receive a ballot or might want additional ways to return it, or for those who are not yet registered but want to take advantage of California\\'s same-day registration system.\\\\n\\\\nLancaster is definitely not the most Democratic part of the state, but it\\'s one of the more Democratic parts of the district, so I guess Republicans are now painting it as a decision to try to change the outcome of the election since the ballots returned so far aren\\'t great for Democrats (note: early returns in mail-in ballots almost always skew older even in vote-by-mail states, while those returned election day or later skew younger. So that\\'s not necessarily a sign Dems will lose).", "154": "&gt; So in California, the Democrats ... have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State\\\\n\\\\nI need a trump University graduate certified in trump translation^\\\\u00ae to explain to me what in the fuck that means.", "155": "Too true.

Last year, barely a month after he was confirmed to his post, he stood before the American people and misrepresented the contents of the long-awaited report by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;The report itself, at 448 pages, documented extensive evidence of those ties, as well as multiple instances of lying and obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump and other top government officials. Mr. Barr\\\\u2019s four-page summary claimed the opposite \\\\u2014 that Mr. Mueller had found no collusion or obstruction of justice. Mr. Mueller protested, and yet weeks passed before Americans could see the report themselves and discover just how much Mr. Barr had twisted its findings to benefit Mr. Trump.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;In March, a federal judge called Mr. Barr\\\\u2019s characterization of the report \\\\u201cdistorted\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cmisleading,\\\\u201d and said his \\\\u201clack of candor\\\\u201d called his credibility into doubt.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;But Mr. Barr didn\\\\u2019t stop there. He also rejected a report by the Justice Department inspector general finding that there was sufficient evidence to open the Russia investigation. He referred to the investigation as \\\\u201cspying\\\\u201d and ordered a criminal inquiry into its origins. He intervened in the prosecutions of two of Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s top advisers, Mr. Flynn and Roger Stone, for whom he recommended a lighter sentence than his own prosecutors had sought. And he declined to open a criminal investigation into last fall\\\\u2019s whistle-blower complaint against Mr. Trump, saying it did not qualify as an \\\\u201curgent concern.\\\\u201d The complaint ultimately led to Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s impeachment.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;Last month, Mr. Barr went on Fox News and called the Russia investigation \\\\u201cone of the greatest travesties in American history,\\\\u201d and said, \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness, there was something far more troubling here; and we\\\\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n&gt;With these remarks, Mr. Barr appears to have violated Justice Department policy against publicly discussing current investigations. His insistent attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the Russia investigation and absolve Mr. Trump of any wrongdoing also appear to violate department policy against taking any actions that could be seen to have a partisan political purpose, especially in an election year.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;The damage Mr. Barr is doing extends beyond policy violations. He has weakened the morale of the department by undercutting career prosecutors \\\\u2014 men and women who devoted their lives to the rule of law. Four of them quit the case against Mr. Stone, who was convicted of federal crimes including perjury, wire fraud and witness intimidation, when Mr. Barr intervened to ask for a lighter sentence. Another quit the case against Michael Flynn shortly before the department filed its request with the court to drop all charges.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;President Trump couldn\\\\u2019t be more pleased. He has shown little sense of the law, other than that whatever it is, he must be above it. He has never given the slightest hint he thinks the Justice Department exists for a reason other than to protect his interests. And no wonder, since he took his cues from President Richard Nixon himself. \\\\u201cI learned a lot from Richard Nixon, don\\\\u2019t fire people,\\\\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \\\\u201cI learned a lot. I study history.\\\\u201d One of the most important lessons? \\\\u201cHe had tapes all over the place. I wasn\\\\u2019t guilty, I did nothing wrong. And there are no tapes.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n[William Barr\\\\u2019s Perversion of Justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/opinion/sunday/michael-flynn-william-barr-justice-department.html)", "58": "Barr is the \\\\", "59": "I\\\\u2019d say there\\\\u2019s a fair bit of shit and lard in there, but yes, metaphysically speaking he is certainly pure fucking evil.", "60": "Lol...why not?
